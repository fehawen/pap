pap - pick a palette
------------------------------

Easily change between your favorite palettes.

No randomness, no fuzz. Pick the palette you want to use, and enjoy the colors.

A selection of palettes is included with pap, but you are encouraged to extend
the selection with your personal favorites.

Each palette defines the 16 ASCII colors in order and in hex format:

Normal      Bright
--------    -------
0 Black      8 Black
1 Red        9 Red
2 Yellow    10 Yellow
3 Green     11 Green
4 Blue      12 Blue
5 Magenta   13 Magenta
6 Cyan      14 Cyan
7 White     15 White
